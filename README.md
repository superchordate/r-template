# r-template

Boilerplate project for analysis in R.

* Add scripts in scripts in folders-first alphabetical order.
* Put library/require statements in run.R.
* The runfolder() function from my bc package will run stuff in functions first, and then scripts.
* Standard folders are provided: input, output, cache. gitignore prevents these from being tracked, so only code is tracked.
